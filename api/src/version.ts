 * The product's version, one string for the API and the web, which ship together (lenzi,
 * 2026-10-03; the build number 2026-10-05): `<prefix><year>.<backend>.<frontend>.<build>`, backend
 * and frontend from 0, the build always four digits (`0000`-`9999`).
 *
 * - `dev`: a development version, on dev or on the branch of work named after it without its build
 *   (`dev26.1.0.0000` on `dev26.1.0`); it may end with a short text for odd work
 *   (`dev26.0.1.0000-squircle`).
 * - `a` alpha, `b` beta, `v` release: final versions, only on main, numbers only.
 *
 * It changes only when lenzi says so: the backend number for an approved backend change, the
 * frontend number for an approved frontend change, the build for a small correction (made on dev,
 * with no branch of its own). A new backend or frontend number sets the build back to 0000
 * (dev26.0.0.0007 -> dev26.1.0.0000). The pages carry a copy of it and of API_LEVEL
 * (web/src/app/app-version.ts, for the Android app): the CI fails when the two differ.
